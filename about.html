                <p>
                  sVAC is a Colombian company dedicated to the development of a new technology for diagnosing food allergies.
                  Our invention is expected to work commercially in pharmacies around the world, making these tests easily accessible and inexpensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    sVAC arose due to the great growth of food allergies worldwide with 3% prevalence in adults and 6% in children.
                    The risk of death from eating a food to which the patient is allergic is too high after anaphylactic shock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is hoped that with our technology, the world population more aware of its allergies and vulnerable groups in
                     advanced or developing countries will also access this information, thus reducing allergic reactions worldwide.
