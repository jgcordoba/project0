          What is Allergy?
        </h1>
        <p>Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a reaction in most people.
         </p>
         <p> Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.
          </p>
          <p>The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.

          Diagnosis
        </h1>
        <p>To evaluate whether you have an allergy, your doctor will likely ask detailed questions about signs and symptoms, perform a physical exam and have you keep a detailed diary of symptoms and possible triggers.
         </p>
         <p> If you have a food allergy, your doctor will likely ask you to keep a detailed diary of the foods you eat and ask if you've stopped eating the suspected food during the allergy evaluation
          </p>

        <h3> Your doctor might also recommend one or both of the following tests. However, be aware that these allergy tests can be falsely positive or falsely negative.
        </h3>
         <ul>
           <li>
            Skin test. A doctor or nurse will prick your skin and expose you to small amounts of the proteins found in potential allergens. If you're allergic, you'll likely develop a raised bump (hive) at the test location on your skin.
           </li>
           <li>
             Blood test. Specific IgE (sIgE) blood testing, commonly called radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or ImmunoCAP testing, measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. A blood sample is sent to a medical laboratory, where it can be tested for evidence of sensitivity to possible allergens.
